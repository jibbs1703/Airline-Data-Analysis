# 2015 Airline Data Analysis

This project uses exploratory data analysis in going through data from airport flights delays and cancellations to make business recommendations for individuals or corporate bodies with an interest in investing in airport location businesses. 

Using the data from flight delays and calcellations for the year 2015, business insights could be made for individual business owners and corporations (regarding making business decisions at the several points of arrival and departure). It also gives some insight into the trend of flight delays and cancellations, which could prove useful to airlines, airport operators and air travel authorities.

## Dataset
The data was collected and published by the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics in early 2016. The USDOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. The data contains information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights as published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report. The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays).
